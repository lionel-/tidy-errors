- Documentation
- Comments
- Input checking

Error reporting isn't a priority but is important nonetheless.

## Principles

1. Clarity
1. Exhaustiveness
1. Conciseness
1. Recognisability

Exhaustiveness: Context matters.
Conciseness: Don't overwhelm.
Recognisability: Repetition is good. Be consistent.
